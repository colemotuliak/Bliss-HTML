# Bliss-HTML

This is an HTML Template that was originally a website made as my final project for my Web Design course.
I continued developing after school was out for a personal website which is still unfinished. I have it to a place I like so I thought I would make it into a template for anyone to use. If you choose to use this template and have any questions, my email is on the home page of my website. Also if I have made any errors, I would love to hear about them and fix them.
